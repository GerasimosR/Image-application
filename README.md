# Image application

A Java program that displays a default image from the local disk as shown below.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GerasimosR/Image-application/master/demo.png)

The three **"Align Left"**, **"Align Center"** and **"Align Right"** keys are used to adjust the image to the left, center and right respectively. The text fields labeled **"Width"** and **"Height"** display the dimensions of the image. If the user inputs new width and height values, then once he clicks on the **"Resize"** button, the display scale of the image changes. Additionally, there is a **"Options"** menu with a specific **"Reset"** sub-selection that restores the image to its original dimensions and a second sub-selection **"Double"** that doubles its width and height.
